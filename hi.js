/*
please make a code for a snake game. 
The points to collect are mouse emojis. 
It needs to be able to go for until you die. 
You need to die if you hit yourself. You need to die if you hit the wall. 
You need to have a point counter. 
You need to make it so that the snake gets slightly bigger with every point it gains. 
It can only gain a point if the head goes over the space. 
It needs to be placed on a pixel grid.
